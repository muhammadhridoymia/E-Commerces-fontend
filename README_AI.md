# Using AI (GitHub Copilot) in VS Code â€” Quick Start

1. Install the "GitHub Copilot" extension from the VS Code Extensions view.
2. Sign in with your GitHub account when prompted.
3. Open a file (e.g., src/Components/CategoryList.js). Copilot suggests inline completions automatically.
4. Accept suggestions with Tab or use `Ctrl+Enter` (or Cmd+Enter on Mac) to open the Copilot pane for alternative suggestions.
5. Ask inline questions by writing a short comment, then accept or edit the generated code.
6. If you prefer experimental features, install "GitHub Copilot Labs".

Notes:
- Keep changes small and test frequently.
- If a suggestion breaks, undo (Ctrl+Z) and try a different suggestion.
